    title: "Gravitational Wave Detection",
    description: "Goal is to develop a pipeline to detect simulated compact-binary gravitational-wave signals embedded in real LIGO detector noise. The project involved signal processing, data synthesis, and machine learning techniques to distinguish gravitational-wave signals from background noise through binary classification.",

    title: "Forecasting and Nowcasting of solar flares",
    description: "The project aims to develop an automated pipeline to extract meaningful features from Aditya-L1 SoLEXS and HEL1OS telemetry and implement physics-informed flare detection and classification. The resulting flare catalogs will be used to train machine learning models to forecast solar flare classes in advance.",
